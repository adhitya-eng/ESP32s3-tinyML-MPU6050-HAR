# 🤖 Human Activity Recognition using MPU6050 & EdgeNeuron (Arduino C++)

This project demonstrates real-time human activity recognition on a microcontroller using the **MPU6050** IMU sensor and a **TensorFlow Lite** model deployed through **EdgeNeuron**. The model recognizes four activities:

- 🚶 Walking  
- 🧍 Standing Still  
- 🤸 Jumping  
- 🏋️ Squatting
